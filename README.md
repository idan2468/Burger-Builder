In progress...

Burger Builder project using React that includes the following:

1. Building a Burger in an interactive and fun way, adding and removing burger ingredients visually.
2. Using Redux to manage App state efficiently and modularly
3. Calling to a REST API server to do some CRUD operations to update the no-SQL MongoDB database.
4. Integrating with third-party packages like axios.
5. Adding user authentication, calling to the REST API to get jwt token.
6. Converting the project to be with just functional components (using  react hooks in the "Convert_To_Hooks" branch)
