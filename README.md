## Technologies
- CSS

- MongoDB
- Express
- NodeJs

## Functionalities
- Building a Burger in an interactive and fun way, adding and removing burger ingredients visually.
- Using Redux to manage App state efficiently and modularly
- Calling to a REST API server to do some CRUD operations to update the no-SQL MongoDB database.
- Integrating with third-party packages like Axios.
- Adding user authentication, calling to the REST API to get JWT token.
- Converting the project to be with just functional components (using  react hooks in the "Convert_To_Hooks" branch)
